Approximate Convex Hulls:

- Approximate convex hulls are very useful because they give a good estimate of the boundary of a set of points, 
  often using much less space than the true convex hull.

- Example:
    The star shape can be represented with a bounding rectangle instead of outlining the entire star.
    This rectangle is the smallest possible rectangle that can fit the star.

Key Concepts:
- cv2.arcLength(): Returns the perimeter of a contour.
- cv2.approxPolyDP(): Approximates the contour shape to a simpler polygon.
- cv2.boundingRect(): Finds the smallest rectangle that encloses the shape.
- cv2.convexHull(): Finds the convex hull â€” a tight-fitting convex boundary.

Difference:
- Approximation = closely traces the actual shape.
- Convex Hull = connects the outermost points to form a convex polygon (e.g., fingertips of a hand).

    cv2.approxPolyDP Parameters:
    - curve: Input contour
    - epsilon: Approximation accuracy (max distance from original curve)
    - closed: Whether the shape is closed

    Convex hull is the convex shape formed by joining the outermost points of a figure.
    - Example: For a hand, the convex hull might be a polygon connecting fingertips and wrist.
