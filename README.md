🛠️ Requirements

Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
MediaPipe
DeepFace
NumPy
SciPy

Install the required packages with a single command:
pip install opencv-python mediapipe deepface numpy scipy

🚀 Usage

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/thorOdinson16/CompVision.git
cd CompVision


Run any script with ease:
python AttendanceSystem.py

or
python VideoCartoonizer.py


Follow the intuitive on-screen prompts (e.g., input source selection for VideoCartoonizer.py).


💡 Notes

Ensure a webcam is connected for live feed scripts (e.g., AttendanceSystem.py, VideoCartoonizer.py).
For AttendanceSystem.py, add face images to the facerec folder, naming them as person names (e.g., John.jpg).
Tweak parameters (e.g., thresholds, kernel sizes) in the scripts to suit your needs.
