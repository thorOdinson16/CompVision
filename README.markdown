# 🎥 CompVision

Welcome to **CompVision**, a captivating collection of computer vision projects crafted with Python and OpenCV! Each script showcases a unique technique or application, designed to inspire and educate.

## 🌟 Files

- `AttendanceSystem.py`: A sleek facial recognition attendance system powered by DeepFace and MediaPipe.
- `CannyEdge.py`: An elegant implementation of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm.
- `Contours.py`: Explores contour detection with centroid calculations.
- `ConvexHull.py`: Dives into convex hull approximations and bounding rectangles.
- `ImageGradient.py`: Masterfully applies gradient detection using Laplacian and Sobel methods.
- `VideoCartoonizer.py`: Transforms video streams into stunning cartoon effects.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- MediaPipe
- DeepFace
- NumPy
- SciPy

Install the required packages with a single command:
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe deepface numpy scipy
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thorOdinson16/CompVision.git
   cd CompVision
   ```

2. Run any script with ease:
   ```bash
   python AttendanceSystem.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python VideoCartoonizer.py
   ```

3. Follow the intuitive on-screen prompts (e.g., input source selection for `VideoCartoonizer.py`).

## 💡 Notes

- Ensure a webcam is connected for live feed scripts (e.g., `AttendanceSystem.py`, `VideoCartoonizer.py`).
- For `AttendanceSystem.py`, add face images to the `facerec` folder, naming them as person names (e.g., `John.jpg`).
- Tweak parameters (e.g., thresholds, kernel sizes) in the scripts to suit your needs.
